## Takeaway lessons from my flipped classroom

   "Welcome to the exciting world of my second flipped classroom adventure!" In today's journal, I'm excited to dive into the fascinating lessons that I've learned through my flipped classroom experience which was Entity Relationship Modeling (ER-Models) and  Entity Relationship Diagrams (ER-Diagrams).

   For now you can imagine that ER-diagrams and Entity Relationship Modeling are like blueprints for a city. Just as city blueprints map out the roads, buildings and parks in a city, ER-diagrams and models map out the data and relationships within a database making it easy to understand  how different pieces of information (entities) are connected and interact with each other, making the database well organized and efficient.

   While framing an ER-model (map) of the database I need to have a clear understanding of the ER-diagrams and its features like (Entity, attributes, relationships , cardinality and key) for mapping the diagram. To create an ER-model, we need to use the special symbols and notations that are like the building blocks of ER-diagrams. Imagine that we are putting together a puzzle, where each piece (symbol) has a specific shape and role . For example, entities are like the main characters, represented by rectangles. Relationships are the connections between these characters, shown with lines or diamonds. Attributes are the details that make these characters unique, represented by ovals. By carefully choosing and arranging these symbols, we can create a beautiful and clear picture of how data is connected in a database.

## My flipped classroom activities 
   
   Today's class was on a journey of  imagination, creativity and exploration. Our module tutor  Miss Palden Ongmo Lhendup divided us into six groups and we were assigned to do a presentation on the ER-model and design a ER-diagram of a real world system in which we have presented on the topics like (Online health book,  Airline ticketing, Mobile Banking Application, Student information management system, Bus booking, Voter registration)

   This  approach allowed us to understand deep into the concepts of Entity Relationship Modeling, encouraging us to think critically and collaboratively. Throughout the session, we engaged in brainstorming and problem-solving, applying the knowledge we've gained from our pre-class materials. This flipped classroom experience not only reinforced our understanding of the ER-model but also fostered teamwork and communication skills. Reflecting on this journey, I'm excited about the potential of our group's presentation and the insights we'll share with the class in upcoming sessions. 

## Feedback
   
   Overall, the flipped classroom sessions were interesting, bustering our knowledge and as we move forward it would greatly help us discover more.  This kind of learning is not just about memorizing facts but also about understanding and applying knowledge, making it a lot more exciting and effective. As we continue on this journey, I'm looking forward to what we'll discover and how we'll grow together.
