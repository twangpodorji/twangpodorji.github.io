# Topic : Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

Hello everyone! Today, I am going to talk about Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), which is a type of deep learning model that is widely used for image recognition and classification tasks. CNNs are designed to automatically and adaptively learn features from image data. Let's dive into the world of CNNs and explore how they work.

## What is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)?

A convolution neural networks in a simple terms mean a neural network that uses convolutional layers to extract features from input images. CNNs are designed to automatically and adaptively learn features from image data. They are widely used for image recognition and classification tasks.

### How does a CNN work?

In convolutional neural networks, the convolution means that a multiplication of values which is impplemented across varies fields. 

In neural networks, convolution is a mathematical operation that involves sliding a small matrix (called a kernel or filter) over the input data and computing the element-wise product between the kernel and the overlapped region of the input. This operation produces a feature map that captures the presence of specific patterns or features in the input data as shown below:

The above process represents a convolution process where a small matrix (kernel or filter) multiplies with overlapping parts of the input data, producing a feature map that highlights specific patterns or features.

### In CNN we need to know about the following terms: 
 **Kernals**:A convolution kernel, or filter, is a small matrix that slides over an image to perform the convolution operation, enhancing the image by extracting specific features.

After one convolution operation, the image can identify patterns, which is fundamental to computer vision tasks like object detection and facial recognition.

There are different types of kernals namely:
* sharpening kernal
* left and right sobel kernal
* Guassian blur kernal and many more. 

**Different terminologies**: 

**Kernal Size**: The kernel size refers to the dimensions of the convolutional filter (kernel) that slides over the input data. In the case of 2D convolutions (for images), the kernel size is represented as (height, width) and for 3D convolutions (for volumes or videos), it is represented as (height, width, depth).

**Padding**: Padding is a process of adding extra pixels or values around the borders of the input data that we use. This is done mainly to control the spatial dimensions of the output feature maps after convolution. Without padding, the output feature maps would shrink in spatial dimensions after each convolutional layer due to the kernel sliding over the input.


**Stride**: Stride determines how many squares or pixels the filters skip when they move across the image, from left to right and from top to bottom. 

For example:
stride = 1 means the filter moves one pixel at a time.

stride = 2 means the filter moves two pixels at a time.

**Input Channels** refer to the number of ways an image stores color information. Here's a breakdown:

* **Channels**: Individual components that carry color information.
* **Color Images**: Typically have 3 channels: Red, Green, and Blue also called as (RGB).
* **Grayscale Images**: Have only 1 channel, representing intensity or brightness.
* **More Channels**: Indicate more "depth" of information in the image.


**Output Channels/Feature Maps:** refers to the number of feature maps or output channels produced by a convolutional layer. Each output channel is the result of convolving the input with a different kernel or filter.

**Depth/Number of Kernels:** This is the number of kernels or filters used in a convolutional layer. It corresponds to the number of output channels or feature maps produced.

In simple terms,  number of kernels = number of output features (maps).

**Pooling**

Pooling means reduction of the size of the inputs, speed up computation, and to make some of the features it detects more robust. 

Different types of pooling are: 
* **Max pooling:** Picks the highest value within the filter area, emphasizing strong features.

* **Average pooling:** Calculates the average value within the filter area, capturing the overall presence of the feature.

* **Min pooling:**  (Less common) Picks the lowest value, potentially useful for specific scenarios.


### Valid v/s Same Convolution 
A valid convolution is a type of convolution operation that does not use any padding on the input.

A same convolution is a type of convolution where the output matrix is of the same dimension as the input matrix.

In the above image:

Padding '**valid**' is the first figure. The filter window stays inside the image.

Padding '**same**' is the third figure. The output is the same size.
