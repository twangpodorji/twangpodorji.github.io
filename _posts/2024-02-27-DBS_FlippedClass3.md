## Today's journal promotes on:
## “My learning outcomes on the Set operations and Null values”

# I. Set Operation
During my flipped classroom session, all the students were divided into four groups in which group 1 and 2 were tasked to be an expert group for the “Set operations in SQL” and other two groups 3 and 4 were tasked to be experts in “Null values in SQl”.  I was in group 2 and our first task was to read and absorb sufficient information so that we could explain it to the home group and they are going to explain about the Null Values.

On learning “Set”, what triggers my mind is that set is a tool like a bag which is used in SQL to  combine the results of any information. To operate/ execute it we have four methods or types to solve it. They are;

  1.Union.
  2.Union All.
  3.Intersection.
  4.Minus

# 1. Union
For me the UNION operation in SQL is like combining two lists of information into one, without any repetition of any information table.
Example ; it's like putting different color marbles  in a bag without repetition of colors.

# 2. Union All
In simple terms, the UNION ALLoperation in SQL is like combining two lists of information into one, with repetition of any information table.
Example ; it's like putting marbles of different and same color in a bag.

# 3. Intersection
The INTERSECT operation in a f SQL is like finding the same information that is present more than table.
For example, if you have one bag with a red, blue, and green marble, and another bag with a green and a yellow marble, with the INTERSECT OPERATOR it  would only give us  the green marble, because it's the only marble that's in both bags.

# 4. Minus
The MINUS operation in SQL is like taking all the information from one table and information that are similar too.
For example, if i have one bag with a red, blue, and green marble, and another bag with a green and a yellow marble, using MINUS OPERATOR i would be able to give the red and blue marbles, because they are the only ones that are in the first bag but not in the second bag.

# II.Null Value
What I have absorbed after learning Null Value is that it's like a box that is empty and that doesn’t have value and is also not equal to any numeric values or words.
Example ; In SQL null values can be like the empty table that doesn't have any information in it.

# Why do we use null value in SQL?
For the values that are given but it's unknown.
Values that are not arranged in their respective columns.
Values that are not in range.
