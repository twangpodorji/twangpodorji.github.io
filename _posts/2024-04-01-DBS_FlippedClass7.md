##  Disk blocks, RAID configurations, and buffer management in databases.

Greetings everyone! Today I will share what I have absorbed during my journey towards the Storage and buffer management. so let's get started üëç...

**Disk blocks** in databases are the smallest units of data that can be read from or written to disk, allowing for efficient data management and access.

**RAID configurations** in databases are methods of combining multiple hard drives into a single logical unit for improved performance, reliability, or both, by using techniques like disk striping (RAID 0), mirroring (RAID 1), or a combination of both (RAID 10)

**Buffer management** in databases involves storing data in memory buffers to reduce disk I/O operations, enhancing performance by minimizing the time spent reading from or writing to disk.

### Databse designed for "chidb" form scratch.

In my learning journey with the "chidb", what I have learned is that I designed a database from scratch, focusing on efficient data storage, query processing, and system functionality, here is my overview of the database designed for "chidb".

* Designed a Database: I started by designing a database from scratch for the "chidb" project.

* B-trees: I explored B-trees, which are crucial for organizing and storing data efficiently.

* SQL Compiler: I worked on the SQL compiler, focusing on the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) and Relational Algebra (RA) for query processing.

* Database Machine (DBM): I developed components within the DBM, including Registers for temporary storage and Cursors for navigating B-trees.

* Programming Skills: I enhanced my programming skills, particularly in C, through implementing these components.

* Practical Understanding: I gained a practical understanding of efficient data storage, query processing, and system functionality.

* Theory and Practice: This journey served as a bridge between theory and practice, reinforcing my comprehensive knowledge of databases.

### Conclusion.
In conclusion, my journey with the "chidb" project has been a transformative experience, deepening my understanding of database design, optimization. Through exploring B-trees, SQL compilers, and the Database Machine (DBM), I've gained some practical insights into efficient data storage, query processing, and system functionality. This hands-on experience has not only solidified my theoretical knowledge but also enhanced my programming skills. Looking forward, I am eager to apply these learnings to future projects, continuing to explore the boundaries of database management and optimization. Thank you for joining me on this journey, and I look forward to sharing more insights with you in the future. üëç
